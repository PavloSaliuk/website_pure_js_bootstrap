            <h3>
              Even now, 120 years later, you can enjoy real beer brewed according to
              medieval recipes.

              <p>
                In 1896, a small brewery was opened by brewers from Europe. Despite
                the fact that New York had already been a huge metropolis, fame
                about our brewery went all over the city. Within 5 years, our small
                brewery was serving several each month thousand customers who were
                true craft beer fans.
              </p>
              <p>
                Time passed, and the brewery expanded. Our business was threatened
                with closure during the Great Depression but we survived. After the
                Second World War, meetings of veterans were often held in our
                brewery, Over a glass of delicious beer, they recalled the old days
                and commemorated the dead.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p class="john_cliff_words">
              «Today our brewery is one of the largest craft beer venues in New
              York. We have kept the recipes of the late 19th century, and we
              strictly adhere to them. The combination of traditions and new
              technologies allowed us to offer the best beer styles for true
              connoisseurs.»
